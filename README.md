# Cortex-Search-Rx-Reviews
Cortex Search app using customer reviews of the CVS Retail Pharmacy

This repo is for assets that create a Cortex Search SiS app.  The cortex search service is built using ten pdfs that represent customer reviews of the CVS Health retail pharmacy.  The .sql file is used to create the stage, parse the files, and chunk them so that they are ready for the cortex search service.  The .py file is the SiS app, branded for CVS Health.  After adopting this file for your Snowflake account, you can take the code and use Cursor to re-brand it as you see fit.
